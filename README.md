# 📐📏 Area and Perimeter Calculator
---
## 🚀 Description

This project is a simple calculator designed to compute the area and perimeter of various geometric shapes. Built using C# (.NET), it leverages the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to provide a clean and extensible structure.

---

## ✨ Features

* Calculates the area and perimeter for the following shapes:
    * ⬜ Square
    * ⚪ Circle
    * ⬜ Rectangle
    * 📐 Triangle
    * (Future support for more shapes is planned!)
* Object-oriented design utilizing a base `Shape` class and derived classes for each specific shape.
* Well-organized and clean code structure with logical folder separation (`Model`, `Logic`, `Helper`).

## 🔮 Future Features

We have exciting plans for the future development of this calculator! Here are some features we're considering adding:

* **More Shapes!** ➕ Support for calculating area and perimeter of other geometric figures like squares, parallelograms, trapezoids, ellipses, and more.
* **Calculation History** 📜 Keep track of your previous calculations for easy reference.
* **Unit Conversion** 📏↔️ Allow users to input dimensions in different units (e.g., cm, inches) and get results in their preferred unit.
* **3D Shapes** 🧊 Expand the calculator to handle basic 3D shapes like cubes, spheres, and cylinders.
* **User Interface (UI)** 🖥️ Develop a graphical user interface for a more interactive and user-friendly experience (potentially using WPF or WinForms).
* **Error Handling** ⚠️ Implement more robust error handling for invalid inputs.
* **Saving/Loading Calculations** 💾 Ability to save and load calculation sessions.

## 💻 How to Use

1.  Clone the repository from GitHub:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Motahare-KamraniFard/Area-and-Perimeter-Calculator.git](https://github.com/Motahare-KamraniFard/Area-and-Perimeter-Calculator.git)
    ```

2.  Open the project in Visual Studio (or any other IDE that supports .NET).
3.  Build and run the project.
4.  The application will prompt you to select the desired shape.
5.  You will be asked to input the necessary dimensions (e.g., radius, length, width).
6.  The program will then calculate and display the area and perimeter of the chosen shape.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

- `Model/` - Contains the C# classes for data models, including input/output (`InputResult.cs`)
- `Logic/` - Contains methods for computing area/perimeter
- `Helper/` - Contains input validation and utility functions
- `Program.cs` - Entry point of the application
